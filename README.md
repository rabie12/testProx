I understand you’re encountering issues with the fromBundle method not being recognized in your Spring Boot application. Let’s address this step by step to identify and resolve the problem.

1. Verify Spring Boot Version

The fromBundle method is part of the WebClientSsl interface, introduced in Spring Boot 3.1. To ensure compatibility:
	•	Check Your Project’s Dependencies:
	•	Maven: Inspect your pom.xml to confirm the Spring Boot version:

<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.0</version> <!-- Ensure this is 3.1.0 or later -->
</parent>


	•	Gradle: Inspect your build.gradle for the Spring Boot version:

implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter:3.1.0' // Ensure this is 3.1.0 or later



2. Ensure Correct Imports

The fromBundle method is available in the WebClientSsl interface located in the org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.reactive.function.client package. Ensure you have the correct import:

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.reactive.function.client.WebClientSsl;

3. Configure the WebClient Bean

When configuring the WebClient with an SSL Bundle, your setup should look like this:

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.reactive.function.client.WebClientSsl;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

@Configuration
public class WebClientConfig {

    @Bean
    public WebClient webClient(WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder, WebClientSsl webClientSsl) {
        return webClientBuilder
                .apply(webClientSsl.fromBundle("mybundle"))
                .build();
    }
}

In this setup:
	•	webClientSsl.fromBundle("mybundle"): Applies the SSL configuration from the SSL bundle named “mybundle” to the WebClient builder.

4. Common Issues and Resolutions
	•	Method Not Recognized:
	•	Spring Boot Version: Confirm you’re using Spring Boot 3.1.0 or later, as earlier versions do not include the WebClientSsl interface.
	•	Dependencies: Ensure you have the spring-boot-starter-webflux dependency, as WebClient is part of this module.

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
</dependency>


	•	Correct Imports: Ensure you’re importing WebClientSsl from the correct package:

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.reactive.function.client.WebClientSsl;



5. Additional Resources
	•	Securing Spring Boot Applications With SSL
	•	Spring Boot SSL Documentation

By verifying your Spring Boot version, ensuring the correct dependencies and imports, and configuring your WebClient appropriately, the fromBundle method should be recognized and function as expected.
